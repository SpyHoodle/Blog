<p>iPods are simple and effective music players, which don&rsquo;t have a high cost yet are probably the best music player you can buy. They are products that give you freedom over your music and control over your device.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-old-ipods-so-great">Why are old iPods so great?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Higher sound quality with a built in DAC for the shockingly rare included headphone jack.</li>
<li>Supports high sound quality formats, like FLAC and ALAC.</li>
<li>Mods - you can repair them, upgrade them, mod them etc.</li>
<li>No internet connection - you won&rsquo;t suddenly loose your music if Apple or Spotify goes down.</li>
<li>Less distraction - just plays music with some games you probably won&rsquo;t play again anyway.</li>
<li>You own your music - you can buy music and put it on here (this is also better for artists.)</li>
<li>Piracy - you can rip music off youtube and take it anywhere. You&rsquo;ll still be able to listen to it when the music on youtube is taken down.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rockbox">Rockbox</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the proprietary Apple iPod operating system, there&rsquo;s an alternative called Rockbox. However devices without an internet connection (as long as your not syncing to iTunes) can&rsquo;t communicate back to apple or the internet, so I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no privacy concern here. With rockbox you do get more features and themes, but I prefer how the original operating system looks.</p>
<h2 id="my-ipods">My iPods</h2>
<p>I have a collection of iPods, for different reasons, and I have only actually bought one.</p>
<h3 id="ipod-shuffle">iPod Shuffle</h3>
<p>This is probably my favourite and coolest iPod, it&rsquo;s a simple, small device that you can literally fit anywhere and play your favourite music playlist on (the storage is pretty limited.) There&rsquo;s no screen, no messing about, just press play. It even has a cool voice feature, where it can tell you the name of the song, battery level, etc.</p>
<h3 id="ipod-mini-gen-2">iPod Mini (Gen 2)</h3>
<p>Even though the storage is also kind of limited, it&rsquo;s enough for me. I love the screen, the old iPod design, and how easy it is to use. The UI is so simple and effective. I don&rsquo;t need album art. I don&rsquo;t need fancy graphics to look at. It&rsquo;s so minimal and yet does the job so well.</p>
<h3 id="ipod-classic-gen-6">iPod Classic (Gen 6?)</h3>
<p>This has the most storage, but I&rsquo;m not a fan of this iPod because it&rsquo;s a bit too new, with a modern display and games and such. The UI also looks terrible, a lot worse compared to the iPod Mini.</p>
