I literally cannot find a good planner and it's driving me crazy.

## A good planner would:
* Follow GTD - capture with an inbox, tags, etc.
* Be native - I don't want a slow unresponsive electron app
* Be open-source - I dont want people spying on what I'm actually doing
* Have an easy to use phone app - so I can check, update or add tasks from anywhere quickly
* Sync with git - reliable, easy, sustainable sync that doesnt require use of a cloud service
* Not be bloated - we don't need timers (super productivity) or calculators (taskwarrior) in our task managers
* Have do and due dates - one of the best features from things (app on iOS and macOS), saying when you'll do something but also keeping the date it's due for (i.e. assignments, projects)

## Is there anything?
There literally nothing that ticks all of these boxes. It's shocking. Regardless, I would say that dstask is probably the best at the moment, but it's still a bit clunky, lacking an actual phone app and do dates, which is pretty critical to my work.

## So, in conclusion
I'm probably going to have to make one of these things myself.
